    "prompt": "Create a vibrant Pixar-style 3D cartoon book cover embodying 'PERFECT EFFORT' philosophy.

Central visual: A diverse group of middle/high school students in a championship arena, each giving their absolute best effort in different ways - not perfect, but fully committed. Show imperfect but earnest attempts: one student helping another up, one studying intensely with determination, one practicing a skill with focus, one being coached and held accountable. All showing EFFORT over perfection.

Foreground: Students with visible determination, sweat, focus - giving everything they have. Some succeeding, some struggling, ALL trying their hardest. Growth mindset visible on faces.

Background: Scoreboard showing 'EFFORT' metrics instead of perfect scores. Championship stadium with blue-gold atmosphere representing life as a game to win.

Symbolic elements:
- Trophy labeled 'Best Effort' (not 'First Place')
- Accountability partners high-fiving
- Growth arrows showing progress over perfection
- Game board/life map showing the journey

Top area: Clean space for title 'PERFECT EFFORT'
Bottom area: Space for subtitle 'Winning at the Game of Life'

Color palette: Championship blue (#2563EB), victory gold (#FBBF24), energetic orange, inspiring atmosphere
Style: Pixar/Disney-quality 3D cartoon realism
Mood: Inspiring, accountable, growth-focused, earnest effort
Message: You don't need to be perfect - you need to give your best effort. That's how we win at life.

NO text in image - text added separately. Pure visual storytelling of the Perfect Effort philosophy."
