# Perfect Effort: Writing Style Guide

## Core Voice Principles

**Who We Sound Like**: A cool coach who gets it. Someone who's been there, knows the struggle, and has your back.

**Who We Don't Sound Like**: A boring textbook, a preachy parent, a condescending adult, or toxic positivity guru.

## The Three Non-Negotiables

### 1. "The sooner you learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the sooner you will win in life."

When you're uncomfortable, that means you're learning. Growth lives in discomfort.

### 2. Focus on the OUTPUT, not the task

Frame everything as what you'll achieve or become, not what you have to do.

### 3. Life is a sport

Consistent metaphor throughout. Training, practice, game day, teamwork, coaching, recovery, championships.

## Voice Examples

### ✅ GOOD: Conversational & Direct

"Here's the thing nobody tells you about waking up early: it's not actually about the alarm. It's about owning those first two hours before the world starts making demands on you. When you control your morning, you control your day. Period."

### ❌ BAD: Preachy & Vague

"You should really try to wake up earlier because successful people do it and it's important for your future. It builds character and discipline."

---

### ✅ GOOD: Output-Focused

"Don't think about 'doing homework for an hour.' Think about mastering the material so well that the test feels easy. That's the output. That's what you're building toward."

### ❌ BAD: Task-Focused

"Make sure you spend at least one hour on your homework every night and study hard for your tests."

---

### ✅ GOOD: Honest About Discomfort

"Yeah, it's going to suck at first. Your bed will be warm, your alarm will be annoying, and you'll question everything. But that discomfort? That's the feeling of your brain rewiring itself. That's what growth feels like."

### ❌ BAD: Toxic Positivity

"Just stay positive! If you believe in yourself and think happy thoughts, waking up early will be easy and fun!"

---

### ✅ GOOD: Specific & Actionable

"Set your alarm for 6:00am and put your phone across the room. When it goes off, count down from 5 and move. Don't negotiate with yourself. 5-4-3-2-1-move."

### ❌ BAD: Vague & Generic

"Try to wake up earlier and be more disciplined with your morning routine. Do your best to stay motivated."

---

### ✅ GOOD: Sports Metaphor

"Think of your morning routine as your pre-game warm-up. NBA players don't show up five minutes before tip-off. They're there hours early, getting their bodies and minds ready. You're doing the same thing for your day."

### ❌ BAD: No Clear Metaphor

"Morning routines are important for productivity and success in various areas of your life including school and personal development."

---

### ✅ GOOD: Contemporary & Relatable

"Look at someone like MrBeast. He didn't wake up one day with 200 million subscribers. He posted videos for years when nobody watched. He focused on the output—becoming undeniably good—not the task of 'making videos.'"

### ❌ BAD: Outdated or Generic

"Many successful people throughout history have worked hard. For example, Thomas Edison tried many times before succeeding."

---

## Paragraph Structure

### ✅ GOOD: Short, Punchy, Varied

"You know that feeling when you're in the zone? When two hours feel like twenty minutes? When you're so locked in that everything else disappears?

That's flow state. And it's not magic.

It's a skill you can build. A state you can trigger. A superpower hiding in plain sight."

### ❌ BAD: Dense, Long, Academic

"Flow state, as defined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, is a mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity, which can be cultivated through specific practices and environmental conditions that facilitate the necessary balance between skill level and challenge."

---

## Opening Hooks

### ✅ GOOD: Immediate & Engaging

"3:47am. That's when Kobe Bryant started his training. Not 6am. Not 'whenever I feel like it.' 3:47am. Every single day.

Why? Because he wasn't focused on waking up early. He was focused on becoming unstoppable."

### ❌ BAD: Slow & Generic

"In this chapter, we're going to talk about the importance of morning routines and how they can help you be more successful. Many successful people wake up early, and we'll explore why."

---

## Coach's Corner Callout Boxes

### ✅ GOOD: Punchy Insight

> **Coach's Corner:**
>
> The 5-Second Rule works because it doesn't give your brain time to talk you out of it. Count backward, not forward. 5-4-3-2-1 creates urgency. 1-2-3-4-5 gives you time to chicken out.

### ❌ BAD: Restating the Obvious

> **Coach's Corner:**
>
> Remember that waking up early is good for you and can help you be more productive throughout your day. Try to be consistent with your alarm time.

---

## Handling Research & Facts

### ✅ GOOD: Light Touch, Practical Application

"Stanford researcher Carol Dweck spent decades studying how mindset affects performance. Her finding? Students who believed they could get smarter (growth mindset) actually did. It wasn't genetics. It wasn't luck. It was belief driving behavior.

Here's what that means for you: when you tell yourself 'I'm bad at math,' you're not describing reality. You're creating it."

### ❌ BAD: Academic & Dense

"According to research conducted by Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck (2006), individuals who maintain a growth mindset—defined as the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—demonstrate statistically significant improvements in academic performance compared to those with a fixed mindset (p < 0.05)."

---

## Action Steps Format

### ✅ GOOD: Output-Framed, Specific

**Step 1: Own Your Morning Before Distractions Hit**

Put your phone in another room tonight. Not on airplane mode. Not face-down. In another room. When your alarm goes off, you'll have to physically get up to turn it off. By the time you're standing, you've already won.

**The Output**: You start your day in control, not reactive.

### ❌ BAD: Task-Framed, Vague

**Step 1: Wake Up Early**

Try to set your alarm for an earlier time and make sure you get out of bed when it goes off. This will help you be more productive.

---

## Tone Dos & Don'ts

### DO:
- Use "you" (second person)
- Ask rhetorical questions
- Be direct and honest
- Acknowledge the hard parts
- Use contractions (you're, it's, don't)
- Include specific details
- Reference current culture
- Make it feel like a conversation

### DON'T:
- Use academic language unnecessarily
- Talk down to readers
- Sugarcoat challenges
- Use clichés ("reach for the stars")
- Be vague or general
- Sound like a corporate motivational poster
- Lecture or preach
- Assume one-size-fits-all

## Examples of Core Philosophy in Action

### Output-Focused Reframes

| ❌ Task-Focused | ✅ Output-Focused |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Go to practice" | "Become unstoppable in your sport" |
| "Do your homework" | "Master the material so tests feel easy" |
| "Wake up at 6am" | "Own your day before anything can derail it" |
| "Study for 2 hours" | "Build the knowledge to ace this exam" |
| "Work out 3x per week" | "Get strong enough to dominate on the field" |
| "Read every night" | "Build a knowledge base nobody can take from you" |
| "Practice instrument daily" | "Get so good they can't ignore you" |

### Comfortable with Uncomfortable

**Situation**: Teaching students to embrace difficulty

✅ **Good Approach**:
"That feeling when you open the textbook and your brain immediately wants to do anything else? That's not weakness. That's your brain recognizing hard work ahead. The students who win aren't the ones who don't feel that resistance. They're the ones who feel it and move anyway. They know discomfort means growth."

❌ **Bad Approach**:
"Sometimes studying is hard, but if you stay positive and believe in yourself, it will get easier and you'll feel better about it."

---

## Contemporary Language

### ✅ Use These:
- Locked in
- In the zone
- Level up
- No cap (sparingly, and only if natural)
- Grind (in context of sports/work)
- Built different
- Next level

### ❌ Avoid These:
- Swag
- Yolo
- On fleek
- Bae
- Lit (unless current when published)
- Any slang that feels forced

**Rule of Thumb**: If you're not sure if slang is current or will sound cringe, don't use it. Timeless language beats trendy language.

## Chapter Opening Templates

### Template 1: The Scenario
Start with a relatable moment that shows the problem.

"It's 10pm. You've got a test tomorrow. Your notes are a mess. Your phone keeps buzzing. Your brain is already making excuses about why you'll do better next time.

Sound familiar?"

### Template 2: The Bold Statement
Lead with a truth that grabs attention.

"Here's something your teachers won't tell you: studying harder doesn't make you smarter. Studying better does."

### Template 3: The Example
Open with a compelling story.

"At 13, Simone Biles was already training 20+ hours a week. Her coaches saw talent. But talent wasn't what made her the GOAT. It was what she did when nobody was watching."

---

## Reflection Questions Format

### ✅ GOOD: Make Them Think

1. What's one thing you're avoiding right now because it's uncomfortable?
2. If you weren't afraid of failing, what would you try?
3. What output do you want to achieve in the next 30 days?
4. Who do you need to become to make that happen?
5. What's your 5-4-3-2-1 moment going to be tomorrow?

### ❌ BAD: Generic & Safe

1. How do you feel about this chapter?
2. Do you think you can apply these ideas?
3. What did you learn today?
4. Will you try to wake up earlier?

## Final Checklist for Every Piece of Writing

Before calling it done, ask:

- [ ] Does this sound like a real person talking?
- [ ] Would a 16-year-old actually want to read this?
- [ ] Is it framed as output, not task?
- [ ] Does it acknowledge the uncomfortable truth?
- [ ] Are examples contemporary and specific?
- [ ] Is the sports metaphor present?
- [ ] Are action steps concrete and doable?
- [ ] Would I cringe reading this out loud?
- [ ] Does it respect the reader's intelligence?
- [ ] Is it genuinely helpful, not just motivational fluff?

---

**Remember**: These kids can smell inauthenticity instantly. Be real. Be useful. Be specific. Focus on outputs. Embrace discomfort as growth.

That's how you write something they'll actually read.
