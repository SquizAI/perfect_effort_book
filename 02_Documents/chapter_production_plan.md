## Efficiency Optimizations

### Pre-Work (Can be done now)
1. Create all 19 chapter outline files (templates with mind assignments)
2. Prepare all Mind Reasoner simulation queries
3. Set up chapter tracking spreadsheet

### Parallel Execution Strategy
- Within each batch: Run 3-5 tasks simultaneously
- Each agent works independently with full context
- Orchestrator manages handoffs and quality checks
- Editor-agent does final polish on each chapter

### Quality Gates
After each batch:
1. Fact-check all chapters in batch (parallel)
2. Cross-reference for consistency
3. Verify output-focused language throughout
4. Ensure sports metaphor consistency
5. Teen voice authenticity check
