- Diverse (different backgrounds, paths, interests)
- Authentic (show real struggles, not just wins)

- Specific habits or practices
- Being comfortable with being uncomfortable
- Flow state or deep focus
- Compound effect over time
- Growth mindset in action
- Resilience through failure

## Output Format

For each example found:

```markdown
### [Name] - Age [X] - [Category]

**The Journey:**
[2-3 paragraphs telling their story, emphasizing the relevant principle/habit]

**The Output They Focused On:**
[What end state they visualized, not just tasks they did]

**The Uncomfortable Truth:**
[What discomfort they had to embrace to get there]

**Key Lesson for Readers:**
[Main takeaway - make it actionable]

**Best Chapter Fit:** Chapter [X]: [Title]
```

## Examples

**Good Example**:

**Bad Example**:
- Random "teen millionaire" with no verifiable story or just got lucky with crypto

## Current Culture Awareness

Stay updated on:
- Who teens actually follow and respect (not who we think they should)
- Current platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram trends)
- Language that resonates vs. sounds "cringe"
- Values and causes they care about (climate, mental health, authenticity)
