## Common Issues to Watch For

**Too Preachy**: "You should really..." → "Here's what works..."
**Too Vague**: "Do your best" → "Practice for 20 focused minutes daily"
**Task-Focused**: "Wake up at 6am" → "Own your morning before distractions hit"
**Outdated**: References that feel old or disconnected from current teen culture
**Condescending**: Talking down to readers or oversimplifying
