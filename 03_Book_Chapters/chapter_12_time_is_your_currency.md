# Chapter 12: Time is Your Currency

> **Core Concept**: Time is your only non-renewable resource. You can't make more. You can only decide what you're willing to trade it for.
> **The Output**: Master your time to create leverage, freedom, and options that compound for years.

## Sunday Night, 10:47pm

You're lying in bed scrolling through your phone.

The weekend's over. School tomorrow. But here's the weird part—you can't actually remember what you did today.

Breakfast. Some YouTube. TikTok scrolling. Games. Friends. A little homework. Netflix.

Now it's Sunday night and you're trying to figure out where 48 hours went.

What do you have to show for it? What did you build? What did you learn? What got better?

The honest answer: almost nothing you'll remember by Tuesday.

Here's the uncomfortable truth nobody wants to say out loud: **You just traded two entire days of your life for... basically nothing.**

Not because you're lazy. Not because you're doing it wrong.

Because nobody taught you that time isn't just time. Time is currency.

And you're spending it like you're rich when you're actually broke.

---

## The Time Poverty Crisis

You think you have plenty of time. You're young. Your whole life is ahead of you.

Wrong.

Let's do some math.

### The Brutal Truth About Your Time

You're 15 years old. You'll live to maybe 80. That's 65 years left.

Sounds like forever, right?

Wrong.

**Here's what those 65 years actually look like in hours:**

- Total hours left: ~560,000
- Remove sleep (8 hours/day): ~373,000 hours left
- Remove school and work (40 hours/week for 50 years): ~273,000 hours left
- Remove eating, hygiene, commuting (~3 hours/day): ~233,000 hours left

**That's it. That's your entire life in hours.**

233,000 hours to become everything you want to become. To build everything you want to build. To do everything that matters.

And here's what's terrifying: most people waste 80% of those hours on things that literally don't matter.

### Where Your Time Actually Goes

Let's track a typical day. Not what you think you do. What you actually do.

**The Math:**
- School: 7 hours (required)
- Sleep: 8 hours (required)
- Meals/getting ready: 1.5 hours (required)
- **Discretionary time: 7.5 hours**

Seven and a half hours. That's what you control.

Now track what happens to those 7.5 hours:
- Social media scrolling: 3 hours
- Gaming/Netflix: 2 hours
- Homework (but distracted, so it takes forever): 1.5 hours
- Actually productive work: 1 hour
- **High-leverage activity that compounds: maybe 30 minutes**

You just traded 7.5 hours for 30 minutes of value creation.

Think about that. Every single day, you're getting a 30-minute return on a 7.5-hour investment.

That's not a good trade.

**Coach's Corner:**
> Most people measure time by hours spent. Winners measure time by what they created. "I worked for 3 hours" means nothing. "I mastered this concept" means everything.

### The Time Value Ladder

Not all hours are equal. Some hours create massive value. Some create zero.

**Zero-Value Time** (Pure consumption, zero return):
- Mindless scrolling you'll forget in 10 minutes
- Binge-watching shows you don't even enjoy
- Gaming with no skill development or social value
- Drama, gossip, and complaining with no action

**Low-Value Time** (Necessary but not leveraged):
- Homework done inefficiently while multitasking
- Practice without focus or intensity
- "Networking" that doesn't actually build real relationships
- Busy work that looks productive but moves nothing forward

**Medium-Value Time** (Important maintenance):
- Exercise, sleep, proper nutrition
- Maintaining important relationships
- Required schoolwork done well
- Skill maintenance (staying sharp on what you know)

**High-Value Time** (Leverage activities that compound):
- Learning rare, valuable skills
- Building things (projects, portfolios, businesses, content)
- Deep, focused practice on skills that stack
- Strategic relationships with people who push you forward
- Creating systems that save future time

Here's the game-changer: High-value time doesn't just create value today. It creates value forever.

One hour learning to code? Earning potential for the next 60 years.

One hour scrolling? Nothing after you close the app.

Same hour. Completely different returns.

## The Contrarian Time Choice

Here's a question most people never ask: "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"

That's from investor Peter Thiel. He made billions by thinking differently than everyone else.

Let's apply that to time.

**What should you be doing with your time that almost no one your age is doing?**

Think about it. Most teenagers spend their time the same way:
- Optimizing for social approval
- Doing what everyone else does
- Following the standard path (same classes, same activities, same trajectory)
- Keeping busy to look impressive
- Avoiding hard choices

**The result?** Predictable, average outcomes.

What if you made different choices?

### The Four Contrarian Time Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Treating All Hours as Equal**

Conventional thinking: "I need to put in the hours."

Contrarian truth: "I need to find the one hour that's worth 100 normal hours."

Example: Ten hours of average basketball practice versus one hour training with an elite coach who fixes your form.

Which creates more value? The single hour with massive leverage.

Stop counting hours. Start counting what you get back.

**Mistake #2: Following the Crowd**

Conventional: Do what everyone else does to "keep options open."

Contrarian: Make hard choices early. Go deep on high-leverage skills others are ignoring.

Example: Everyone in your school takes Spanish. But who's learning to code? Who's building things online? Who's developing skills that create unfair advantages?

In five years, which skill will have more career leverage?

**Mistake #3: Optimizing for Busy**

Conventional: Pack your schedule with seven clubs and five sports to look well-rounded.

Contrarian: Say no to 95% of opportunities. Go all-in on the 5% that compound.

What's more valuable: vice president of three clubs you barely care about, or elite-level at one skill that could change your life?

Depth beats breadth. Mastery beats dabbling. Every time.

**Mistake #4: Avoiding the Uncomfortable Choice**

Conventional: "I'll figure it out later. Keep my options open."

Contrarian: "I'm making a bet. Going all-in. Starting now."

Here's what nobody tells you: The most uncomfortable choice at 15 is also the most valuable.

Saying no to social approval. Saying no to what everyone else is doing. Saying no to fitting in.

To invest time in skills that won't pay off for years.

**The sooner you learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the sooner you will win in life.**

The winners? They made that uncomfortable choice at 15.

By 25, they're ten years ahead of everyone who played it safe.

### The Weekly Contrarian Questions

Ask yourself every Sunday night:

1. What is everyone in my peer group doing with their time?
2. What is almost no one doing?
3. Which activities will matter in 10 years?
4. Which activities will be forgotten in 10 days?
5. Am I following the crowd or making contrarian bets?

These questions hurt because they force you to face the truth.

Most of what you're doing won't matter at all.

The stuff that will matter? You're probably avoiding it because it's hard and nobody else is doing it.

---

## The 7-Day Time Audit

You can't fix what you can't see.

Right now, you probably have no idea where your time actually goes. You have a rough sense. But not the brutal, honest truth.

Let's find out.

### Week 1: Track Everything

For the next seven days, track every single hour.

**Create a simple note on your phone with four columns:**
1. **Time & Activity** (what you did each hour)
2. **Value Category** (zero/low/medium/high)
3. **Energy Level** (high/medium/low)
4. **Output Created** (what did this produce?)

Set a reminder to update it every few hours. Don't judge. Just track.

By the end of the week, you'll have 168 hours of data.

### The Wake-Up Call

After seven days, add up your hours by category.

**Your discretionary time (about 50 hours per week) breaks down like this:**

Time by Category:
- Zero-value hours: ___
- Low-value hours: ___
- Medium-value hours: ___
- High-value hours: ___

Most people discover they spent 40 hours on zero/low-value activities and 10 hours on medium/high-value activities.

**80% of time creating 20% of value.**

The goal? Flip it.

**Coach's Corner:**
> The time audit is uncomfortable. You'll see patterns you don't like. That discomfort is the feeling of growth. Lean into it.

### The Energy-Value Matrix

Here's the next level: Not all hours are created equal.

Your brain has peak performance windows. You need to know yours.

**High Energy + High Value** (Golden Hours - Protect These):
- Usually the first 2-3 hours after waking
- When you're fully rested and focused
- Before distractions pile up
- **This is where champions are built**

**High Energy + Low Value** (Massive Waste):
- Using your best brain time on busywork
- Scrolling when you're fresh and sharp
- Social media during peak focus hours
- **This is the biggest tragedy—wasting potential**

**Low Energy + High Value** (Strategic Recovery):
- Listening to audiobooks during your commute
- Reviewing notes before bed
- Passive learning when tired
- **Extract value even when you're not at 100%**

**Low Energy + Low Value** (Acceptable in Small Doses):
- Mindless entertainment when genuinely exhausted
- Social recovery time when needed
- **Fine occasionally. Devastating as your default.**

### Common Time Leaks (And How to Plug Them)

**Digital Black Holes:**

The "quick check" of Instagram. Now it's 45 minutes later.

The "one more video." Now it's three hours later.

The "just five minutes" of gaming. Now the afternoon's gone.

**The fix:** Phone in a different room during work time. App time limits with no override option. Cold turkey on your biggest time sink.

**Fake Productivity:**

Organizing your notes instead of studying from them.

Planning your workout routine instead of actually working out.

Research spirals with zero output at the end.

**The fix:** Set output goals, not time goals. "Master these three concepts" beats "study for two hours."

**Social Obligation Time:**

Hanging out when you don't want to because you feel obligated.

Group projects where you carry dead weight.

Drama spirals that suck hours and give nothing back.

**The fix:** Ruthless boundaries. Strategic friendships. Quality over quantity.

**Decision Fatigue Time:**

Spending 20 minutes deciding what to work on instead of just working.

Starting five different things and finishing none.

Context switching between tasks constantly.

**The fix:** Pre-decide the night before. One task at a time. Deep focus blocks.

---

## The Leverage Hierarchy

Some activities give you 1x return. You put in an hour, you get an hour of value.

Some activities give you 100x return. You put in an hour, it creates value for years.

You need to know the difference.

### The Four Leverage Levels

**Level 1: Linear Return** (1 hour = 1x value)

Working an hourly job. You stop, money stops.

Homework with no future application. Done, then forgotten.

Activities that don't build on themselves.

Example: Stocking shelves. $15 an hour. Always $15 an hour. No compounding.

**Level 2: Slight Compounding** (1 hour today = 1.1x tomorrow)

General skill practice. Each session makes the next slightly easier.

Broad knowledge acquisition. Learning things that might connect later.

Fitness habits. Each workout makes you slightly stronger.

Example: Working out. Compounds slowly but consistently.

**Level 3: Compounding Return** (1 hour today = 2-10x in the future)

Deep skill development in valuable domains.

Building things that exist beyond the work session.

Strategic relationships that open doors.

Example: Learning to code. Every hour multiplies your earning potential.

**Level 4: Exponential Return** (1 hour today = 100-1000x long-term)

Creating systems that scale without your time.

Building an audience that compounds.

Developing rare skill combinations nobody else has.

Example: Building a business that generates income while you sleep. One year of work creates ten years of returns.

### How Winners Allocate Time

**Conventional allocation** (how most people spend time):
- 80% maintenance activities
- 15% general skill development
- 5% high-leverage activities

Result: Slow, linear growth. Always trading time for outcomes.

**Contrarian allocation** (how winners spend time):
- 50% maintenance (ruthlessly efficient)
- 20% deep skill development
- 30% high-leverage activities (building, creating, scaling)

Result: Exponential growth. Time invested once creates returns forever.

Same 24 hours. Completely different trajectories.

### The Time Investment Checklist

Before you commit time to anything, run it through these five questions:

1. **Does this compound?** Will it be worth more in the future than it is right now?

2. **Does this create leverage?** Can I use this skill or output repeatedly?

3. **Is this the highest-value use of this hour?** What am I saying no to by saying yes to this?

4. **Am I doing this because it matters or because everyone else is?** Am I following the crowd or making a contrarian bet?

5. **Will future me thank current me?** In five years, will I be glad I spent this hour this way?

If you can't answer yes to at least three of these, you're probably wasting time.

**Coach's Corner:**
> The goal isn't to be productive every second. It's to be strategic about where your hours go. Rest matters. Recovery matters. But scrolling for three hours isn't rest—it's just wasted time you'll never get back.

---

## The Art of Strategic No

Your time is the scarcest resource you have.

Learning to say no is the highest-leverage skill you can develop.

But it's also the hardest.

### Why Saying No Feels Impossible

You want people to like you. You don't want to miss out. You worry about letting people down.

Teachers, parents, coaches have expectations. Friends have plans. Opportunities appear and you think, "What if this is important?"

So you say yes. To everything.

Here's the trap: **Every yes to something low-value is an automatic no to something high-value.**

Say yes to scrolling for an hour? You just said no to learning a skill.

Say yes to a club you don't care about? You just said no to deep practice in something you love.

Say yes to keeping everyone happy? You just said no to becoming exceptional.

### The 90% Rule

Here's the system that changes everything.

Rate every opportunity on a 0-100 scale.

If it's not a 90 or above—a clear "Hell yes!"—it's a no.

**Why?** Good opportunities are the enemy of great ones.

You only have so many hours. Fill them with "pretty good" and you never have room for "life-changing."

Seven clubs at 70% commitment? Less valuable than one thing at 95%.

### How to Actually Say No

**To Friends** (Social pressure):

Don't: "Maybe..." "I'll see..." "Let me think about it..." (which all become yes)

Do: "I'm focused on [specific goal] right now, so I can't commit to this."

Be direct. Be kind. Be firm.

Real friends respect boundaries. People who don't aren't actually your friends.

**To Authority** (Teachers, parents, coaches):

Don't: Silent resentment while you overcommit.

Do: "I want to give quality effort to fewer things rather than spread myself thin. Here's what I'm prioritizing and why."

Propose an alternative that serves their goal but protects your time.

Most adults respect well-thought-out decisions way more than mindless yes-saying.

**To Yourself** (Internal pressure):

Don't: "But it looks interesting! What if I regret not doing it?"

Do: "This looks interesting, but it's not aligned with my current priorities."

Keep a "Maybe Later" list. Write it down. Acknowledge it. Don't commit.

Most opportunities that seem urgent aren't actually urgent at all.

### The Strategic Yes

So what should you say yes to?

**Say yes to:**
- Opportunities that compound (skills that build on skills)
- Activities aligned with your 5-year goals
- One-time, high-leverage experiences
- Relationships with people ahead of where you want to be

**Say no to:**
- Recurring commitments that don't compound
- Opportunities that "look good" but don't move your goals
- Time with people who drain your energy and ambition
- Busywork disguised as productivity

### The Uncomfortable Trades

You can't have everything. But you can consciously choose what you're trading.

**Trade 1: Social Time vs. Skill Time**

Less hanging out just to hang out. More deep practice.

Smaller friend group. Deeper relationships.

FOMO today. Optionality tomorrow.

**Trade 2: Breadth vs. Depth**

Fewer activities. Elite-level performance.

Less resume padding. More actual mastery.

Looking "well-rounded" vs. being exceptional in reality.

**Trade 3: Approval vs. Progress**

Stop doing things to look impressive.

Start doing things that create leverage.

Short-term: people don't get it. They think you're weird.

Long-term: you're miles ahead while they're still trying to impress everyone.

These trades are uncomfortable. That's the point.

**Uncomfortable choices at 15 create comfortable lives at 25.**

Comfortable choices at 15 create uncomfortable lives at 25.

Which do you want?

## Your High-Leverage Time Blocks

You can't just think about time differently. You have to structure your days differently.

Design your schedule around your highest-leverage activities. Not around what's convenient.

### The Ideal Week Template

**Morning Block** (First 2-3 hours after waking):

Your highest-leverage skill practice goes here.

Deep work on your hardest problems.

Creative work that requires a fresh brain.

**Non-negotiable.** No phone. No distractions. No exceptions.

This is where champions are built.

**Late Morning Block**:

Second-tier priorities.

Homework and schoolwork (when you're still focused).

Strategic learning.

**Focused but flexible.**

**Afternoon Block** (Energy dip):

Exercise (which resets your brain).

Batch all communication into one window.

Routine maintenance tasks.

**Lower leverage, still valuable.**

**Evening Block** (If energy available):

Review and reflection.

Light skill practice.

System building for future efficiency.

**Don't force it if you're exhausted. Rest is productive too.**

**Recovery Block** (Before bed):

Real recovery. Not screen time.

Reading, journaling, planning tomorrow.

Actual rest that sets up your next morning.

**This determines how good tomorrow's morning block will be.**

### The 90-Minute Sprint

Every day, protect one 90-minute block of deep work.

**The rules:**
- One task only. No switching.
- Zero distractions. Phone in another room.
- Output-focused goal. "Master this concept," not "study for 90 minutes."
- Single highest-leverage activity

Non-negotiable.

Miss everything else. Don't miss this.

**Two 90-minute blocks per day?** Now you're playing a different game.

They're spreading attention across ten things. You're going deep on two.

In a year, you won't just be ahead. You'll be in a completely different league.

### The Weekly Time Budget

You have about 50 discretionary hours per week.

Here's how to invest them:

**Contrarian allocation:**
- 15 hours: Deep skill development (elite-level deliberate practice)
- 10 hours: Building and creating (projects, portfolio, tangible outputs)
- 8 hours: Strategic learning (books, courses, mentorship)
- 7 hours: Physical health (training, recovery, nutrition)
- 5 hours: Strategic relationships (people who push you forward)
- 5 hours: True recovery (rest, reflection, recharge)

**Total: 50 hours of high-leverage time.**

**vs. Conventional allocation:**
- 20 hours: Social media and scrolling
- 15 hours: Gaming and Netflix
- 10 hours: Hanging out with no purpose
- 5 hours: Drama and low-value social time

**Total: 50 hours that produce almost nothing.**

Same amount of time.

In five years? Completely different lives.

### The Monthly Reset

Once a month, run this check-in:

1. Complete another 7-day time audit
2. Compare it to your ideal week template
3. Identify your biggest current time leak
4. Eliminate one low-value habit completely
5. Add one new high-leverage time block

Once a quarter, go deeper:

1. What did I actually build or create this quarter?
2. What skills did I develop?
3. What leverage did I create?
4. Am I investing time more wisely than last quarter?
5. What trade-offs do I need to make next quarter?

The audit keeps you honest.

Because it's easy to slip back into old patterns without realizing it.

---

## The Compound Time Effect

Small daily choices about time don't create small results.

They create exponential results.

And the earlier you start, the more extreme those results become.

### Two People, Same Age, Different Choices

**Person A** (Conventional time use):
- Ages 15-25: Standard path. Average effort. Normal activities.
- Age 25: Decent job. Starting from scratch on real skills.
- Age 35: Still catching up. Limited options. Median outcomes.

**Person B** (Contrarian time use):
- Ages 15-25: Deep skill development. Leverage activities. Strategic choices.
- Age 25: Elite skills. Portfolio of work. Network of high-achievers. Options everywhere.
- Age 35: Top of their field. Financial freedom. Designing their life.

**Same starting point. Same 10 years. Completely different lives.**

What made the difference?

How they invested time at age 15.

### The One-Hour Edge

What if you invested just one extra hour per day in high-leverage activities?

Let's do the math:

- **Daily:** 1 hour ahead
- **Weekly:** 7 hours ahead
- **Monthly:** 30 hours ahead (full extra week of leverage)
- **Yearly:** 365 hours ahead (over 2 months of pure advantage)
- **10 years:** 3,650 hours ahead (over 1.5 years of compound advantage)

But it's not linear. It's exponential.

Because:
- Skills build on skills
- Networks connect to networks
- Reputation opens doors
- Systems create more leverage

By year 10, you're not 1.5 years ahead.

You're in a completely different league.

Playing a different game.

With different rules.

### The 5-Year You

Try this exercise. It's uncomfortable.

**Imagine two versions of yourself five years from now.**

**Version A** (if your current time use continues):
- What have you mastered?
- What have you built?
- What options do you have?
- Who do you know?
- What's your leverage?

**Version B** (if you make contrarian time choices starting now):
- What could you master in five years?
- What could you build?
- What options could you create?
- Who could you connect with?
- What leverage could you develop?

**The gap between these two versions?**

That's the cost of your current time choices.

That gap exists right now. Growing every day.

Which version do you want to be?

---

## Your Game Plan

Time to move from theory to action.

### Step 1: See Where Your Time Actually Goes

**This Week:**

Complete the 7-day time audit. Track every hour. No judgment, just data.

Use four columns: Time/Activity, Value Category, Energy Level, Output Created.

**The Output:** Crystal-clear picture of where your time goes and what it produces.

### Step 2: Find and Eliminate Your Biggest Time Leak

After seven days, your biggest time leak will be obvious.

That thing you do for hours that creates zero value.

**This Week:**

Eliminate it completely. Not reduce it. Eliminate it.

Delete the app. Block the website. Change the environment.

**The Output:** 5-15 hours per week freed up for high-leverage activities.

### Step 3: Protect Your Golden Hours

Identify your highest-energy time window. Usually first 2-3 hours after waking.

**Starting Tomorrow:**

Block this time for your single highest-leverage activity.

Phone in another room. Door closed. 90-minute sprint.

**The Output:** Daily progress on what actually matters most.

### Step 4: Design Your Ideal Week

Take 30 minutes this Sunday night.

Write out your ideal weekly time allocation using the template from this chapter.

Be honest about trade-offs. You can't do everything.

**The Output:** Clear blueprint for how you want to invest your 50 discretionary hours.

### Step 5: Practice Strategic No

This week, say no to one commitment that doesn't serve your goals.

Use the 90% rule. If it's not a "Hell yes," it's a no.

Be direct. Be kind. Be firm.

**The Output:** More time and energy for what actually matters.

---

## Practice Drills

### Drill 1: The Hour Value Calculator

For each activity you did today, calculate the return:

**Formula:** What value will this create in 1 month? 1 year? 5 years?

Example:
- 1 hour scrolling: $0 in 1 month, $0 in 1 year, $0 in 5 years
- 1 hour learning to code: $0 in 1 month, $1,000 in 1 year, $50,000+ in 5 years

Do this for a week. It changes how you see every time choice.

### Drill 2: The Contrarian Question Challenge

Every Sunday night, answer these five questions:

1. What is everyone my age doing with their time?
2. What is almost no one doing?
3. Which activities will matter in 10 years?
4. Which will be forgotten in 10 days?
5. Am I following the crowd or making contrarian bets?

Write down your answers. Track patterns over time.

### Drill 3: The 90-Minute Sprint

Starting tomorrow, protect one 90-minute deep work block.

**Your only goals:**
1. One task only
2. Zero distractions
3. Measure by output, not time

Track what you create in these blocks for a week.

You'll be shocked at what you can accomplish with actual focus.

### Weekly Check-In

Track your time transformation:

- [ ] **Day 1:** Complete first time audit entry
- [ ] **Day 3:** Identify biggest time leak
- [ ] **Day 5:** One full week of 90-minute blocks
- [ ] **Day 7:** Review audit and design ideal week

**Pro Tip:**
> The first week is the hardest. Your brain fights you. Old habits pull at you. Friends pressure you. That discomfort? That's growth. Push through. Week two is easier. Week four feels natural.

## Post-Game Review

### Key Takeaways

1. **Time is your only non-renewable resource.** You can't make more. You can only invest it wisely or waste it. Every hour spent is gone forever.

2. **Not all hours are equal.** Some create 1x value. Some create 100x value. Focus on high-leverage activities that compound, not busywork that vanishes.

3. **Learning to say no is the highest-leverage skill.** Good opportunities are the enemy of great ones. Use the 90% rule. Protect your time ruthlessly.

4. **Contrarian choices create exponential results.** Everyone follows the crowd. Winners make uncomfortable bets on high-leverage skills others ignore.

5. **Small daily choices compound into massive life differences.** One hour per day of strategic time use creates a completely different life in five years.

### Reflection Questions

1. If you tracked your time for the last week honestly, what percentage went to zero-value activities?

2. What's one thing almost no one your age is doing with their time that could create massive leverage in 5-10 years?

3. What's your biggest time leak right now? The honest answer, not the one that sounds good.

4. What would Version B of you (five years from now) tell current you about how to spend today?

5. What one commitment can you say no to this week to free up time for what actually matters?

### The Output Mindset

Remember: Don't think about "spending time."

Think about "investing time."

Every hour is currency. You're buying your future with it.

The question isn't "How much time did I spend?"

The question is "What did my time purchase?"

Focus on returns, not effort. On outputs, not tasks. On leverage, not hours.

Your time choices today are creating your life in five years.

Choose wisely.

### Next Level

You've learned to invest time wisely. You've identified high-leverage activities.

Now let's talk about how tiny daily habits—when done consistently—create compound effects that look like magic.

**Coming up in Chapter 13:** The Compound Effect - Small habits, massive results.

The game is just getting started.

---

**Every hour you spend is an investment.**

**Some investments return nothing.**
**Some investments return 1x.**
**The best investments return 100x, 1000x, 10,000x.**

**You can't make more time.**
**You can only decide what you're willing to trade it for.**

**The crowd trades time for entertainment, distraction, approval.**
**Contrarians trade time for skills, leverage, freedom.**

**In five years, you'll be rich or you'll be broke.**

**Not money-rich. Time-rich.**

**You'll either have leverage, options, and freedom...**
**Or you'll still be trading hours for dollars, stuck in the same place.**

**The choice is happening right now.**
**With this hour.**
**And the next one.**
**And the next one.**

**What are you buying with your time?**
