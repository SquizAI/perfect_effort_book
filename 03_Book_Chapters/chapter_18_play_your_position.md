## <span style="color: #0969DA">The Two Athletes</span>



It's late October. Junior varsity basketball tryouts just ended. Two sophomores walk out of the gym, same height, same build, same amount of sweat soaking through their shirts.

Meet Jordan and Casey. Both 6'1". Both put in the work over summer. Both dreaming of making varsity next year.

Fast forward one year.

**Jordan's Story:**

Jordan spends every practice trying to be like the players in NBA highlights. Watches Steph Curry drain three-pointers and tries to copy his form. Sees Ja Morant throw down dunks and attempts to do the same. Forces shots from logo range because that's what gets the crowd going.

The problem? Jordan's got decent handles but weak compared to the point guards. Can jump but not high enough to consistently finish at the rim. Shoots threes but only hits 28% of them.

Coach's feedback halfway through the season: "You're trying to do everything and excelling at nothing. What's your actual position?"

Jordan doesn't have an answer.

By season's end, Jordan's riding the bench most games. Stats: 3.2 points per game, mostly garbage time. Starts thinking maybe basketball isn't the right game.

**Casey's Story:**

Casey watches the same highlights but comes to a different conclusion: "I'll never be the tallest or most athletic player on the court."

So Casey asks a different question: "What am I actually good at?"

The honest answer? Vision. Passing. Defense. Not flashy stuff, but real skills.

Casey stops worrying about being the top scorer. Instead: becomes the best passer on the team. Leads the JV team in assists by December. Masters help-side defense, making life miserable for opposing scorers. Doesn't get the highlight reels, but makes everyone else better.

Coach's feedback: "You're irreplaceable because you play YOUR game, not someone else's."

By junior year, Casey's starting point guard. By senior year, team captain. The team wins the league title. Casey gets recruited by three colleges—not as a scorer, but as a floor general who makes everyone around them better.

Same talent. Same opportunity. Same gym.

Completely different results.

**The difference?**

Jordan tried to be good at everything and ended up mediocre at everything. Casey found a unique value and became exceptional at it.

Jordan competed in everyone else's game. Casey created their own.

Here's what nobody tells you: the key to winning isn't being the best at everything. It's being exceptional at your thing. The thing only you can do the way you do it.

Let's talk about how to find your position and dominate it.

## <span style="color: #0969DA">The Problem: The "Good at Everything" Trap</span>



There's this lie floating around that sounds really good on paper:

"Well-rounded is best. Be good at everything."

Your school pushes it. College applications reward it. Parents preach it. The message is clear: fill your resume with everything. Be the athlete AND the straight-A student AND the volunteer AND the club president AND the artist.

Don't specialize. Diversify.

Sounds smart, right?

Here's what actually happens when you try to be good at everything:

You spread yourself thin across ten different areas. You become mediocre at many things and exceptional at nothing. You're constantly comparing yourself to people who are better than you at their specialty, which means you always feel like you're losing.

You're exhausting yourself trying to compete on everyone else's terms. And in the process, you completely miss your actual competitive advantage.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *The Comparison Trap*


Social media makes this worse. You scroll through your feed and see everyone's highlight reel at their best thing.

Your friend posts about making honor roll. Another friend shares their new bench press PR. Someone else is performing in the school play. Another just launched a podcast.

And you're sitting there thinking: "I'm not the smartest. I'm not the strongest. I'm not the most talented. I'm not the most creative."

You compare your weak areas to their strengths. Result? You feel like you're losing at everything.

Reality check: you're not losing. You're just playing the wrong game.

Here's what the research shows. Economists call it "comparative advantage"—you don't have to be the best at everything. You just need to focus on where you have a relative advantage.

Strengths-based psychology backs this up. Study after study shows that 80% of your growth comes from building on strengths, not fixing weaknesses. Yet most people spend 80% of their energy trying to fix what they're naturally bad at.

In business, they call it "differentiation strategy." You don't win by being the same as everyone but slightly better. You win by being different. By offering something nobody else can.

The pattern is clear across fields: specialists dominate. The well-rounded get replaced.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">The Solution: Own Your Position</span>

Whitney Wolfe Herd built a $13 billion company by refusing to play someone else's game.

After leaving Tinder, she could have tried to build a direct competitor. A dating app that was just like Tinder but a little better.

She didn't.

Instead, she created a completely different game. A women-first dating app where women make the first move. She turned what most people saw as a disadvantage—being a woman in male-dominated tech—into her superpower.

She built Bumble on a simple principle: "Don't compete where you can't win. Create a game where your strengths are the winning moves."

That's what playing your position means.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Here's how it works:*




1. Identify your unique strengths (what you're naturally good at)
2. Double down on those strengths (become exceptional, not just good)
3. Stop trying to compete where you're naturally disadvantaged
4. Turn your "weaknesses" or "differences" into competitive advantages
5. Create your own lane instead of fighting for space in someone else's

Think about it like an actual sports position.

In football, you don't ask your kicker to throw touchdowns. You don't ask your quarterback to kick field goals. Each position has a role. Each player maximizes their unique skills.

Life works the same way.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Ask yourself three questions:*



> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *1. What am I naturally good at?*


Not what you think you should be good at. What actually feels easy to you but hard for others?

What do people come to you for help with? What activities make you lose track of time because you're so engaged?


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *2. What makes me different?*


What's your unusual combination of skills or interests? What perspective do you have that others don't? What would you do differently if you were in charge?

Your differences aren't weaknesses. They're your competitive advantage.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *3. Where can I be exceptional instead of mediocre?*


Where's your unfair advantage? What could you be in the top 10% at with focused effort? What's the smallest niche where you could dominate?

Notice: we're not asking "where can I be average at everything?" We're asking "where can I be exceptional at my thing?"

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Reframe: Strengths vs. Weaknesses</span>

Here's the old model most people follow:

"Fix your weaknesses until you're well-rounded."

Result? You become mediocre at everything, exceptional at nothing. You spend all your energy getting from terrible to okay instead of getting from good to great.

Here's the new model:

"Build on strengths. Manage around weaknesses."

Result? You become exceptional at your thing. You delegate, partner, or use tools to handle the rest.

This isn't giving up. This is strategy.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *The 80/20 Rule of Personal Development:*


80% of your growth comes from building strengths. 20% comes from fixing critical weaknesses—only the ones that actually block you from progress.

If you're a writer who can't spell, use spellcheck. Don't spend three years becoming a spelling champion. That's not your position.

If you're a coder who struggles with public speaking, focus on writing clear documentation. You don't need to become a TED speaker. That's not your position.

If you're a visual artist who isn't great at math, use calculators and collaborate with someone who loves numbers. Don't torture yourself through advanced calculus. That's not your position.

Fix the weakness enough that it doesn't block you. Then get back to building your strength.

**Coach's Corner:**

> Well-rounded sounds safe. But in the real world, specialists win. Companies hire experts, not generalists. Audiences follow people who are the best at their thing, not pretty good at several things. Be spike-shaped—deep expertise in your area—not flat across everything.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Why This Works</span>

The research is clear on this.

Gallup studied this with their CliftonStrengths assessment. People who use their strengths daily are six times more engaged. Strengths-based teams outperform other teams by 12-15%. Focusing on strengths reduces burnout and increases performance.

Positive psychology pioneer Martin Seligman found the same pattern. Building on what you're good at creates sustainable excellence. Fixing weaknesses only gets you to "average."

In business strategy, Michael Porter proved that differentiation beats direct competition. A unique value proposition creates a defensible position. "Best" is subjective and constantly changing. "Different" is valuable and defensible.

The Japanese have a concept called "ikigai"—your reason for being. It's the intersection of four things: what you're good at, what you love, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.

Your position is where these overlap.

Whitney Wolfe Herd found hers. She didn't try to beat Tinder at their game—the bro-culture, aggressive, male-dominated approach to dating apps. She created a different game entirely: women-first, safety-focused, respect-driven.

She turned being female in tech—often seen as a disadvantage in Silicon Valley—into her superpower. She built features that reflected her unique perspective. Women make the first move. BFF mode for friendships. Bizz mode for professional networking.

The result? A company worth $13 billion. She became the youngest woman to take a company public as CEO. All because she played her position instead of trying to be someone else.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">The Output You'll Create</span>

When you play your position, here's what you gain:


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Clarity on Your Value*


You stop guessing what makes you special. You know exactly what you bring to the table.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Competitive Advantage*


You stand out instead of blending in. When everyone else is fighting for space in a crowded lane, you've got your own lane.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Higher Performance*


Excellence in your lane beats mediocrity everywhere. It's math. 10/10 in one area creates more value than 5/10 in ten areas.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Authentic Confidence*


Not fake confidence based on pretending to be someone you're not. Real confidence based on genuine strengths.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Strategic Energy Use*


You stop wasting effort where you can't win. You pour everything into where you can dominate.

**Clear Direction**

Career choices become easier. Life decisions become clearer. You're building toward what you're uniquely good at.

Here's how to reframe your thinking:

| Don't Think | Think |
|-------------|-------|
| "I need to be good at everything" | "I need to be exceptional at my thing" |
| "My differences are weaknesses" | "My differences are my competitive advantage" |
| "I should compete with everyone" | "I should create my own lane" |
| "Well-rounded is best" | "Spike-shaped is best—deep in my strength" |
| "Fix my weaknesses first" | "Build my strengths, manage around weaknesses" |
| "I'm falling behind [comparison]" | "I'm playing a different game than them" |

The world doesn't need another version of someone else. It needs the first version of you.

## <span style="color: #0969DA">Real-World Examples</span>




> 💡 **Key Insight**
> **Example 1: Simone Biles - Turn Your "Disadvantage" Into Your Superpower**
>

Simone Biles is 4'8". In a sport where height is often considered an advantage for elegance and grace, she's one of the shortest elite gymnasts.

She could have tried to compete on traditional gymnastics terms—long lines, balletic grace, the classic "ideal gymnast" aesthetic.

She didn't.

Instead, she owned her position. She built her entire approach around what HER body could do. Power. Explosion. Difficulty. Physics-defying moves that shorter, more compact frames can generate.

She created skills that literally no one else in the world could perform. Skills that are now named after her. The "Biles" on floor exercise. The "Biles" on balance beam. The "Biles II" on floor.

Her "disadvantage"? It became her superpower.

The result: She's the most decorated gymnast in history. Seven Olympic medals. Twenty-five World Championship medals. She changed the sport's scoring system because she was too good at her thing.

She didn't try to be the most graceful gymnast. She became the most powerful. That was her position, and she dominated it.

**The Lesson:** Your "disadvantage" might be your superpower if you own it instead of hiding it.


> 💡 **Key Insight**
> **Example 2: MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) - Find Your Unique Combination**
>

Jimmy Donaldson didn't set out to be the best looking YouTuber. Or the funniest. Or the most technically skilled video editor.

He combined something different: crazy ambitious ideas, genuine generosity, and an obsessive understanding of what makes videos go viral.

That's his position. Nobody else has that exact combination.

He spent years studying YouTube analytics while most creators were guessing. He gave away millions of dollars while most creators were keeping ad revenue. He organized massive challenges while most creators were filming in their bedrooms.

At 13, he started posting videos. Nobody watched. He kept going. By 15, he was studying viral content like it was a science. He posted hundreds of videos with barely any views.

Most people would have quit. But he wasn't competing to be like other YouTubers. He was creating his own game.

Now? Over 200 million subscribers. His videos regularly get 100+ million views. He's built a business empire around his unique position: the YouTuber who creates spectacles nobody else can match.

**The Lesson:** Find your unusual combination. Don't try to be the best at one thing someone else already dominates. Combine multiple strengths in a way that's uniquely yours.


> 💡 **Key Insight**
> **Example 3: Angela Ahrendts - Stack Your Different Experiences**
>

Angela Ahrendts was CEO of Burberry, then became Senior Vice President of Retail at Apple.

She didn't try to be the cheapest retailer. She didn't compete on having the most locations. She didn't follow traditional retail playbooks.

Her position? Luxury retail meets technology meets humanity.

At Burberry, she brought a fashion brand into the digital age. Live-streamed fashion shows. Built a robust online presence. Connected physical stores with digital experience. Her unique combination: deep fashion expertise plus tech-forward thinking.

At Apple, she transformed retail stores into "town squares"—community spaces, not just transaction centers. She brought her luxury background to tech retail. Made the shopping experience about connection, not just buying stuff.

Under her leadership at Burberry, the stock price increased 250%. At Apple, retail revenue doubled.

She didn't hide her fashion background when she entered tech. She didn't pretend to be a pure tech executive. She leveraged her unique combination.

**The Lesson:** Your unusual combination of experiences IS your position. Don't hide it. Build on it.


> 💡 **Key Insight**
> **Example 4: Alex - The High School Connector**
>

Alex started sophomore year trying to do everything. Decent grades—3.2 GPA. Played two sports, spent most of the time on the bench. Joined random clubs. Felt stretched thin and mediocre at everything.

Junior year realization: "I'm not the smartest kid in AP classes. I'm not the best athlete. But I'm really good at bringing people together."

That was Alex's position. The connector. The culture-builder. The person who made people feel seen and valued.

So Alex shifted focus:

Started a school podcast interviewing students and teachers. The show showcased voices that usually didn't get heard—the quiet kid in the back, the janitor everyone ignored, the teacher who used to be a pro athlete.

Organized community service projects that actually got people involved. Not the resume-padding kind. Real projects solving real problems in the local area.

Created a mentorship program pairing seniors with freshmen. Built a system where upperclassmen actually cared about helping new students adjust.

Used social media to showcase school culture—not the fake highlight reel, but real moments of connection and community.

The results?

Alex's college essay wrote itself. It wasn't about having a 4.0 or being team MVP. It was about the unique position of being a community-builder.

Admissions officer feedback: "We have thousands of applicants with perfect grades. We need people like you who bring humans together."

Accepted to dream school. Now leading multiple student organizations in college. Exactly the same position, just bigger stage.

**The Lesson:** You don't need to be valedictorian or MVP. Find YOUR thing and own it. Be exceptional at what you're naturally good at.

## <span style="color: #0969DA">Your Game Plan</span>



### <span style="color: #0969DA">Step 1: Discover Your Unique Strengths</span>

You can't play your position if you don't know what it is.

Time for radical honesty. Answer these questions:


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *1. What feels easy to you but hard for others?*


Think about activities where you think "Why is everyone struggling with this?" Things people regularly ask you for help with.

Maybe you can explain complex concepts simply. Maybe you notice details others miss. Maybe you can sense what people are feeling before they say it.

Write it down: _______________________________


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *2. What makes you lose track of time?*


When you're in flow state, hours feel like minutes. What are you doing when that happens?

Not what you think you should enjoy. What actually pulls you in so deep that you forget to check your phone?

Write it down: _______________________________


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *3. What do you do better than most people you know?*


Not world-class yet. Just top 20% among your peers. Where do you have natural talent plus developed skill?

Be specific. "I'm good with people" is too vague. "I can make strangers feel comfortable in conversations within two minutes" is specific.

Write it down: _______________________________


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *4. What would your friends say you're great at?*


This matters because we're often blind to our own strengths. Ask five people: "What's one thing I'm uniquely good at?"

Their answers will reveal patterns you might miss.

Write it down: _______________________________


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *5. What's your unusual combination?*


Most people are good at A or B. What are you good at that's A AND B?

Examples:


- "I'm good at coding AND explaining things simply"
- "I understand data AND I'm creative with presentations"
- "I'm competitive in sports AND I'm genuinely empathetic"

Write it down: _______________________________

**The Output:** You now have a list of 3-5 potential strengths to build on.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *The StrengthsFinder Framework (Simplified):*


Strengths typically fall into four categories:

**Executing** - Getting things done. You're the organizer, the achiever, the one with discipline.

**Influencing** - Leading and persuading. You're the communicator, the competitor, the natural leader.

**Relationship Building** - Connecting people. You're empathetic, you build teams, you create community.

**Strategic Thinking** - Analysis and innovation. You're the learner, the strategic planner, the idea generator.

Most people have one or two primary categories. That's your starting position.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Step 2: Find Your Competitive Advantage</span>

Now we're getting specific. Draw three overlapping circles:

**Circle 1: What am I good at?** (your strengths from Step 1)

**Circle 2: What do I enjoy?** (your energy sources—what lights you up)

**Circle 3: What do people need or value?** (market demand—what creates value)

Your position is where all three circles overlap.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Example - Alex the Connector:*




- Good at: Bringing people together, organizing events, storytelling
- Enjoy: Meeting new people, building community, creating content
- People need: Connection, belonging, student voice being heard

**Alex's position:** School culture-builder and student voice amplifier.

**Your Turn:**

| Circle | Your List |
|--------|-----------|
| **Good at** | 1. _______________________ <br> 2. _______________________ <br> 3. _______________________ |
| **Enjoy** | 1. _______________________ <br> 2. _______________________ <br> 3. _______________________ |
| **People need** | 1. _______________________ <br> 2. _______________________ <br> 3. _______________________ |

**Your position (where they overlap):** _______________________________

Now write your position statement using this template:

"I am uniquely positioned to [value you create] because I combine [strength 1] and [strength 2] in [context]."

Examples:


- "I am uniquely positioned to build inclusive team culture because I combine empathy and competitive drive in athletics."
- "I am uniquely positioned to explain complex concepts because I combine deep technical knowledge and storytelling ability in STEM education."
- "I am uniquely positioned to launch creative projects because I combine artistic vision and business thinking in entrepreneurship."

**Write yours:**

_________________________________________________________________

**The Output:** You now have a clear position statement. This is your lane. This is what you build on.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Step 3: Stop Competing Where You Can't Win</span>

This step is hard. But necessary.

It's time for a comparison audit.

List three areas where you're constantly comparing yourself to others:



1. _______________________________
2. _______________________________
3. _______________________________

For each area, ask three questions:



- Is this one of my natural strengths? (Yes/No)
- Does competing here energize me or drain me? (Energize/Drain)
- Can I be top 10% here with focused effort? (Yes/No/Unlikely)


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *If the answer is "No / Drain / Unlikely" → Strategic Retreat*


Let's be clear about what strategic retreat means:

It's not quitting. It's redeploying energy.
It's not giving up. It's strategy.
It's not accepting defeat. It's choosing your battles.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Here's what you do:*




1. **Good enough in weak areas** - Do what's required, not what's perfect. Free up energy for where you can dominate.



2. **Pour energy into your strengths** - Use your freed-up time and focus on your actual position.



3. **Stop measuring yourself** against people playing different games. Their game isn't your game.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Example - Jordan vs. Casey (the basketball players):*


Jordan's strategic retreat would have been: Stop trying to be the top scorer (not the natural strength). Pour that energy into becoming an elite passer and defender (natural strengths). Stop measuring success by points scored (someone else's game) and start measuring it by assists and defensive stops (Jordan's actual position).

If Jordan had done this sophomore year, the story would have ended differently.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Your Strategic Retreats:*


| Area to Pull Back From | Why It's Not My Position | Where I'll Pour Energy |
|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1. _________________ | _____________________ | ______________________ |
| 2. _________________ | _____________________ | ______________________ |

**The Output:** You just freed up 10-20 hours per week. Energy you were wasting trying to be someone you're not. Energy you can now pour into dominating your actual position.

**Coach's Corner:**

> Letting go isn't weakness. It's strategy. The best players in any sport know their role. They don't try to do everything. They do their thing at an elite level. That's how teams win championships.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Step 4: Double Down on Your Strengths</span>

Now that you know your position and you've freed up energy, it's time to go all in.

Don't just be "good" at your thing. Become exceptional.

Top 10%. Then top 5%. Then top 1% among your peers.

Excellence creates opportunities that don't exist for the merely competent.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *The 10,000 Rep Principle:*


You need volume. Deliberate, focused repetition in your strength area.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Here's how to build dominance:*



> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *1. Get Deliberate Practice*


This isn't mindless repetition. This is structured improvement with feedback.

Find a coach or mentor who's ahead of you in your position. Get their feedback regularly. Track your progress measurably.

If your position is "connector," study community-building strategies. Interview people who are great at it. Get feedback on your approach.

**2. Do Volume**

Do your thing MORE than anyone else around you.

Daily practice, not occasional. Consistency compounds.

If you're a writer, write daily. If you're a connector, connect daily. If you're an analyst, analyze daily.

**3. Showcase It**

Let people KNOW this is your position.

Build a portfolio. Create proof of your strength. Enter competitions. Share your work publicly.

Example: If you're great at explaining concepts, start a YouTube channel or blog. If you're a connector, host events and share the outcomes. If you're a visual thinker, create infographics and post them.

Visibility matters. Being great in private doesn't create opportunities.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *4. Stack Your Strengths*


Combine your strengths into unique combinations. That's where the real magic happens.

"Great designer" is good. "Great designer + understands code" is rare and valuable.

"Good writer" is common. "Good writer + deep technical knowledge" opens doors in technical writing, documentation, and thought leadership.

Find the intersection. Build there.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Your Dominance Plan:*


**My Position:** _______________________________

**Goal:** Be in the top ___% in this position within 12 months.

**Daily Practice:**

I will _______________________________ (specific action) every single day.

**Mentorship:**

I will ask _______________________________ (specific person) to coach me on this.

**Showcase:**

I will create _______________________________ (specific project/portfolio) to demonstrate my position.

**Combination:**

I will stack my strength with _______________________________ (complementary skill).

**The Output:** A clear path from "good" to "exceptional" in your position. This is how you become irreplaceable.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Step 5: Rewrite the Rules</span>

This is the Whitney Wolfe Herd move. If you don't like the game, change it.

Most people accept the rules they're given. They compete within existing structures, even when those structures don't value their strengths.

Winners create new games where their strengths ARE the rules.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *When to Rewrite Rules:*




- The existing game doesn't value your strengths
- You keep losing at someone else's game
- You see a need that current rules don't address
- Your unique perspective reveals a better way


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *How to Rewrite Rules:*



> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *1. Identify the Broken Rule*


What rule or norm doesn't make sense? What would you change if you were in charge?

Whitney's version: "Why do men always message first on dating apps? That creates an environment where women get harassed."

That was the broken rule. Most people accepted it. She didn't.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *2. Design Your Alternative*


What would a game look like that values YOUR strengths? What rules would make your position the winning position?

Whitney's alternative: "Women message first. This creates safety, respect, and puts women in control."

That was the new rule. It flipped the entire dynamic.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *3. Test Your New Game*


Start small. Don't bet everything on an untested idea.

Run an experiment. Find others who resonate with your rules. Get feedback. Iterate.

Whitney tested Bumble with a small group first. Refined the concept. Then scaled it.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *4. Own It Publicly*


Share why you're playing differently. Invite others to join your game. Build community around your new rules.

Whitney didn't hide the fact that Bumble was different. She made it the main feature. "Women make the first move" became the brand.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Examples of Rule Rewriting:*


| Traditional Rule | New Rule | Result |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| "Grades = Success" | "Measurable impact = Success" | Student creates community program with metrics showing real change |
| "Most goals = Best player" | "Makes everyone better = Best player" | Player focuses on assists and defensive leadership, becomes team captain |
| "Follow career path" | "Create your own role" | Entrepreneur builds position that didn't exist before |


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Your Rule Rewrite:*


**Broken rule I'm tired of:** _______________________________

**My alternative:** _______________________________

**Small experiment to test it:** _______________________________

**Timeline:** _______________________________

**How I'll measure if it's working:** _______________________________

**The Output:** You're no longer playing someone else's game. You're winning at yours.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Step 6: Turn Differences Into Advantages</span>

Your "weaknesses" or "differences" might be your greatest competitive edge.

Society teaches us to hide what makes us different. To fit in. To minimize the things that make us stand out.

That's exactly wrong.

Your differences are often your superpowers in disguise.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *The Difference Inventory:*


List three things about you that are different from most of your peers:



1. _______________________________
2. _______________________________
3. _______________________________

For each one, ask:


- How is this usually seen as a disadvantage?
- How could this actually be an advantage?
- What can I do BECAUSE of this difference that others can't?


> [!NOTE]

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Exercise 1: The Strengths Finder Survey</span>

**Week 1 Challenge:** Ask five people who know you well this question:

"What's one thing I'm uniquely good at? What makes me different from most people you know?"

| Person | Their Answer | Patterns I Notice |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|

What patterns emerge? Are you surprised by anything? Do they see strengths in you that you've been ignoring or downplaying?

**Action:** Write your position statement based on this feedback. This is your lane.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Exercise 2: The Comparison Detox</span>

**Week 2 Challenge:** For seven days, track every time you compare yourself to someone else.

How many comparisons were in areas that AREN'T your position? What would happen if you just stopped comparing yourself in those areas?

**Action:** Pick ONE comparison trap to consciously release this month. When you notice yourself falling into it, redirect: "That's not my game. I'm playing a different position."

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Exercise 3: The Position Showcase</span>

**Week 3 Challenge:** Create something tangible that showcases your unique position.

**Options:**
- Write an article or blog post about your position and what you're building
- Create a project that demonstrates your strength in action
- Start a small business or service using your position
- Enter a competition in your strength area
- Teach a workshop or create tutorial content about your thing


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *Your Showcase Plan:*


What I'll create: _______________________________

Timeline: _______________________________

Who I'll share it with: _______________________________

Success looks like: _______________________________

**The Goal:** Move from "I think this is my position" to "I'm KNOWN for my position."

Visibility matters. Showcase your position publicly.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Exercise 4: The Rule Rewrite Experiment</span>

**Week 4 Challenge:** Identify one "rule" or "norm" that doesn't work for you, and run a 30-day experiment with an alternative.

**Template:**

**Current rule/norm:** _______________________________

**Why it doesn't work for me:** _______________________________


> [!NOTE]
> **🎯 Core Principle**
> **My alternative rule:** _______________________________


**Small experiment to test it:** _______________________________

**Timeline:** 30 days starting _______________________________

**How I'll measure success:** _______________________________

**Example:**



- Current rule: "Success in school = highest grades"
- Doesn't work: I learn better through projects and real-world application, not memorization for tests
- Alternative: "Success = demonstrated mastery through applied projects"
- Experiment: Propose project-based assessment option to one teacher instead of traditional test
- Timeline: This semester
- Measure: Do I learn more? Do I enjoy it more? Does my final project show deeper mastery than a test would?

**Your Experiment:**

Don't just complain about rules that don't fit you. Test alternatives. Be the person who creates better games.

## <span style="color: #0969DA">Post-Game Review</span>



### <span style="color: #0969DA">Reflection Questions</span>



1. **What are my top three natural strengths?** Am I building on them or ignoring them?



2. **Where am I trying to be "well-rounded" instead of exceptional at my thing?** What would happen if I shifted that energy?



3. **What's my unique position that no one else can claim?** Can I state it in one clear sentence?



4. **What comparison am I ready to release because it's not my game?** How much energy would that free up?



5. **How would my life change if I fully owned my position instead of trying to be someone else?** What would I start doing? What would I stop doing?

> [!TIP]
> ### Key Takeaways


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *1. You Don't Have to Be Best at Everything*


Be exceptional at YOUR thing. That creates more value than being mediocre at ten things.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *2. Your Differences Are Your Competitive Advantage*


What makes you "different" or "weird" is what makes you valuable. Don't hide it. Build on it.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *3. Stop Competing Where You Can't Win*


Strategic retreat isn't quitting. It's choosing your battles. Create your own lane instead of fighting for space in someone else's.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *4. The World Needs YOU, Not Another Copy*


The world doesn't need another version of someone else. It needs the first version of you.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *5. Build Strengths, Manage Weaknesses*


80% of your energy should go into building strengths. 20% into managing critical weaknesses. Not the other way around.


> [!NOTE]
> **💭 Key Insight**
> *6. Playing Your Position Creates Clarity*


When you know your position, decisions get easier. You know what's your game and what's not. You know where to invest time and where to pull back.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Your Position Statement</span>

Take a minute and write this clearly. This is your north star:

"I am uniquely positioned to _________________________________ because I combine _________________ and _________________ in _________________."

Pin this somewhere you'll see it daily. This is your lane. Own it.

### <span style="color: #0969DA">Next Level Preview</span>

You've found your position (Chapter 18). You know what makes you unique. You know what lane you're competing in.

But here's the thing: playing your position internally isn't enough.

The world needs to KNOW your position. You need to showcase it strategically. You need to build a personal brand that makes your value impossible to miss.

That's exactly what Chapter 19 is about: building your personal brand. How to make sure the right people know what you're great at. How to create opportunities by being visible in your position.

You've got the position. Now let's make sure everyone knows you own it.

---

**Coach's Corner:**

> The uncomfortable truth? Most people never find their position because they're too afraid to stop trying to be everything. They spread themselves thin chasing "well-rounded" and never become exceptional at anything. Don't be most people. Find your position. Double down. Dominate your lane. That's how you win.
